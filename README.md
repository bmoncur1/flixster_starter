### Application Features

#### CORE FEATURES

- [X] User can view a list of current movies from The Movie Database API as a grid view
  - The grid element should have an id of `movies-grid`
  - Each movie wrapper element should have a class of `movie-card`
- [X] For each movie displayed, user can see the following details:
  - Title - the element should have a class of `movie-title`
  - Image - the `img` element should have a class of `movie-poster`
  - Votes - the element should have a class of `movie-votes`
- [ ] User can load more current movies by clicking a button at the bottom of the list
  - The button should have an id of `load-more-movies-btn`.
  - When clicked, the page should not refresh.
  - New movies should simply be added to the bottom
- [X] Allow users to search for movies and display them in a grid view
  - There should be a search input element with an id of `search-input`
  - Users should be able to type into the input
  - When a user hits 'Enter', it should send a search request to the movies API
  - The results from the search should be displayed on the page
  - There should be a close icon with an id of `close-search-btn` that exits the search, clears results, and shows the current movies displayed previously
- [X] Website accounts for basic HTML/CSS accessibility features
- [X] Website should be responsive

#### STRETCH FEATURES

- [ ] Deploy website using GitHub Pages. 
- [ ] Allow user to view more details about a movie within a popup.
- [X] Improve the user experience through CSS & animation. Note: 
    - I added a feature that color-coded the various ratings/votes. This provides a visual for the user to easily see how a movie was rated (green/orange/red).
- [ ] Allow movie video trailers to be played using [embedded YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en)
- [ ] Implement anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

### Walkthrough Video

`TODO://` Add the embedded URL code to your animated app walkthrough below, `ADD_EMBEDDED_CODE_HERE`. Make sure the video or gif actually renders and animates when viewing this README. (ðŸš« Remove this paragraph after adding walkthrough video)

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I think the labs were good preparation for the end of week project. The parts of the lab that I struggle with, happen to be the same parts of the project that I struggled with. For me, working with API's is a bit tedious because I'm not as familiar with the concept being that I'm new to web development. There are so many steps involved with gaining access to the correct information from the API. 

This weekend, I plan to create a few bare-bones, simplistic websites that require the use of an API, until I create the muscle memory where I won't have to rely so heavily on help from outside sources. I'll also make time to relax and rejuvenate too. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If given more time, I would try to find a more cohesive, professional, clean and organized UI scheme. I would also try implementing the card pop-up feature, as well as adding in a YouTube video for users to watch trailers of the video. I really wanted to have the movie cards scroll horizontally, like you'd typically see on many websites. This is something I may try researching and implementing in the future. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Many of my peers seem to have a firm grasp of the content. I love seeing what they create. I'm a very visual person, so I appreciate seeing everyone's take on a project. I loved seeing animation implemented in on project. I also loved the backgrounds and color schemes some peers chose to use. 

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

I would like to give a shout-out to Snigdha. She was in my pod helping my partner with an issue relocating her button to the bottom-center of the page. I stopped to listen in and learned about the Pesticide for Chrome Extension and how to use it. I don't think Snigdha was even aware that I was following along because my camera was off (I like to turn my camera off while I'm working to help me focus). Her explanations were so easy to follow. I immediately used it and was able to solve a similar issue in a fraction of the time it would have normally taken. Thank you, Snigdha!

I also want to shout-out to all of the TA's and instructional team. Everyone seems genuinely happy and eager to help. Thank you all!
